## Android Swipe Gestures ##

If you own a smartphone, you already know what a gesture is. Gestures are those subtle motions to trigger interactions between the touch screen and the user.

Generally, it lasts for the time between the first touch on the screen to the point when the finger leaves the surface.

In Android you can easily implement the Android swipe gestures. Android provides a GestureDetector class to receive motion events and tell us that these events correspond to gestures or not.

Here, weâ€™ve created a tutorial on [How to Implement Android Swipe Gestures in Android App Using GestureDetector Class](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-swipe-gestures-tutorial/).
